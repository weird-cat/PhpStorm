PhpStorm Theme
==============

WeirdCatTheme is modified Eli's Dark Theme.

Installation
------------
Typically you would like to copy icls xml file to appropriate php storm directory.
Installation of themes is described in [php storm themes help](http://phpstorm-themes.com/help/).

You can also create symlink to this file so you will just pull from server and my changes will be applied to your theme on next php storm restart.
